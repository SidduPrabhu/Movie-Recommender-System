# Movie-recommender-system

This project focuses on building a movie recommender system using the TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset and deploying it as a website. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and user preferences, the recommender system suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their historical interactions and ratings.

**Project Overview**
A movie recommender system is an essential tool for streaming platforms and movie enthusiasts to discover new movies based on their interests and preferences. This project aims to develop an effective movie recommender system using machine learning algorithms and make it accessible to users through a web interface.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is obtained from TMDb and contains a comprehensive collection of movies, including features such as title, genre, release year, cast, crew, ratings, and user reviews. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to extract relevant information for building the recommender system.

**Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: The TMDb dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format the data into a suitable structure for building the recommender system.

**Feature Engineering:** Relevant features such as movie genres, cast, crew, and user ratings are extracted and engineered to represent the characteristics of each movie and user preferences effectively.

**Model Selection:** Collaborative filtering techniques such as user-based and item-based recommendation algorithms are explored to identify similar users or items and make personalized movie recommendations.

**Model Training:** The selected recommendation model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between users, items, and ratings.

**Website Development:** The trained movie recommender system is deployed as a website using web development frameworks such as Flask or Django. Users can interact with the website to input their preferences and receive personalized movie recommendations in real-time.

**Results**
The deployed movie recommender system effectively suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical interactions. Users can explore new movies, discover hidden gems, and enhance their movie-watching experience through the recommendations provided by the system.
